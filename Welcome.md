## Welcome to the breakglassincaseofcyber wiki! 

Far too often I find myself needing information for IR purposes. For example: What's the listing of xyz important Linux artifacts? What commands can I run in windows to see recently modified system files?

More often than not it's around log files and the locations of things on Windows and Linux


I've decided to publicly collate all the information that I currently have available and also information available to assist everyone. There are large amounts of knowledge out there, and I want to make it easier to get (especially in the heat of the moment IR). There are also some amazing guides out there:
* [Blue Team Field Manual](https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Team-Handbook-condensed-Responder/dp/1500734756)
* [Blue Team Handbook: Incident Response Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Team-Field-Manual-White/dp/154101636X)

The above books have excellent information, however I find that while books are an excellent resource often having to search through volumes is not great during IR, also books may be on kindles, peoples phones, might be a PDF and also hard to share. Books can sometimes be hard to search for specific information.

This wiki is going to start by being a repository for technical information specifically. There are many guides, books and materials on IR theory. Maybe later that information will be added, however at this time it will purely be technical information.

This information will be mirrored on github at [IR Wiki](https://github.com/breakglassincaseofcyber/Incident-Response-Wiki)

Collaboration is encouraged. I am but a mere creature of bone and flesh, so things may be missed or simply, I am absolutely not across everything and need other peoples help.
